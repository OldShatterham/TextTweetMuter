# TextTweetMuter
Tampermonkey script which hides tweets (by certain users) that don't contain any media in your home timeline.
At the moment it just sets the tweet's opacity really low.

Note: This script will probably break if Twitter touches the code/design/anything, I also only checked it like once.
